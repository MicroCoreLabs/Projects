# MCL86jr Accelerator Board

This board is a drop-in replacement for the 8088 CPU inside of the PCjr.  It utilizes a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA and 512KB of SRAM.

The CPU core is the MCL86 and can be run in cycle accurare mode which boosts PCjr performance by almost 6X which is close to the speed of an 8Mhz IBM PC AT!

The board schematic and layout were done using KiCad and all of the development files are in the PCBA directory. The board was manufacured and assembled by PCBWay.


Updated on 4/15/2025
- Microcode and EU files updated to integrate bug fixes found in the MCL86 on the MiSTer PCXT project
- FPGA Configuration Files folder added which contains the FPGA direct programming .bit file and also the configuration Flash .mc file
